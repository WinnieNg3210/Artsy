### User Authentication
New users can sign up for a new account or they can user the demo login to checkout the features of the site.

### Product listings
Users are able to see all of a product's information by selecting any images from the home page: description, price, title, the seller and all of the reviews for this product. They can toggle on the description button to read through what the product is about.

### Reviews
Logged in users will be able to add a new review, select how many stars they want to give for the product, edit their existing review and edit the amount of stars in the edit page. If a non logged in user looks at the product page, they will be able to see past reviews but they won't be able to create nor edit any reviews.

### Shopping Cart Item
Logged in users can add items to their shopping cart. From the product show page they can choose how many quantities of the item they'd wish to purchase, which will be reflected in the checkout page. The user can also update the quantity in the checkout page as well. Users can also remove the product from their shopping cart if they wish to do so. The total price will be reflected based on what is in the shopping cart and the quantity for each product.
